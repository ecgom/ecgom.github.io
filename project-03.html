            <p>In this project, I examined the relationship between the prevalence of religious and non-profit establishments and county-level health outcomes in the United States. A better understanding of the social make-up of community and how it affects health, allows for policymakers and local decision makers to be more effective in communicating, providing and nurturing health-enhancing services for their citizens. I used several multiple linear regression models on a social capital dataset (RGF) proposed by Rupasingha, Goetz & Freshwater, and the 2018 County Health Rankings dataset.</p>

            <h3>01 — Problem & Hypothesis</h3>
            <br>
            <p>Social capital is a term to describe the observable aspects of social organisation at the ecological level, such as the density of social establishments and networks or patterns of civic engagement within a community. A place with low social capital is reported to negatively affect community members’ ability to form social ties and gain information, which in turn affects that community’s population health outcomes.</p>
            <br>
            <h5><i>A place with low social capital is reported to negatively affect community members’ ability to form social ties and gain information, which in turn affects that community’s population health outcomes.</i></h5>
            <br>
            <p>We studied two establishments that influence social capital at the US county level: religion- based and non-profit establishments. We argued that religious establishments and non-profit establishments influence health in different ways. We theorised that community religiosity positively affects a community’s subjective mental and physical health outcomes, however, lack in health-directed programs that target the reduction of premature death. We suspected non-profit organisations are associated with reduced rates of premature death through community and health programs, and in turn improve community member’s perceptions of physical and mental health.</p>

            <h3>02 — Methods & Results</h3>
            <br>
            <p>Three multiple linear regression models were conducted to assess the association between number of religious and non-profit establishments, and health outcomes of premature death, physically unhealthy days and mentally unhealthy days at the county level, while controlling for a county’s median household income, education, and black/white racial segregation rate. <br>
            Our findings suggested that counties with higher instances of religious establishments were associated with better self-reported physical and mental health, but increased rates of premature death. Counties with higher instances of non-profit establishments were associated with decreased rates of premature death, but weaker negative associations with self-reported physical and mental health.</p>

            <h3>03 — Discussion</h3>
            <br>
            <p>Religious establishments showed a stronger inverse association to reported average physically and mentally unhealthy days compared to non-profit establishments. A possible interpretation of this is that religious establishments may be a more enriching resource for social ties and norms for community members compared to non-profit organisations. Another interpretation could be that more religious communities may perceive health in a holistic way that encompasses their beliefs and values and thus may respond differently to subjective health questionnaires.</p>
            <br>
            <h5><i>Religious establishments showed a stronger inverse association to reported average physically and mentally unhealthy days compared to non-profit establishments.</i></h5>
            <br>
            <p>The inverse association between non-profit establishments and years of potential life lost (YPLL) supports our hypothesis that denser areas of non-profits may improve community health outcomes by providing more services that contribute to health factors and/or health directly. It is difficult to determine a causal link, given that the prevalence of non-profit establishments does not necessarily equate to service effectiveness within a county.</p>
