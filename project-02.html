						<p>Data visualisation</p>
					</div>
					<!-- /work details info -->
					<div class="work__details_text">
            <p>Pitchfork is an American online music magazine that reviews albums. At times, a review they publish can be widely contested by artists themselves and their fans.
In this analysis, I wanted to gain a better understanding of the nature of how Pitchfork rates albums by dissecting reviews by genre and year.
It was found that Rock albums had the most top-rated albums compared to other genres. Moreover, a spike in top-rated albums in a genre in a given year was associated with retrospective reviews: reviews about and after the passing of a notable musician.</p>

            <h3>01 — Questions & Assumptions</h3>
            <br>
            <p>My first goal was to dissect Pitchfork reviews by genre to see if Pitchfork was biased towards a certain genre. My personal assumptions on Pitchfork is that they do seem to cover a lot of indie and alternative music.</p>
            <br>
            <p>Secondly, I wanted to see which were the highest and lowest rated albums of each genre by year and if there were any interesting patterns to be seen overtime. Was there a resurgence in highly rated albums for a given genre in one year?</p>

            <h3>02 — Methods</h3>
            <br>
            <p>I employed a visualisation technique for my exploratory analysis. Inspired by my previous work with Campsite and stream graphs, I combined the graphical representations found in these two methods so it was suitable for the temporal Pitchfork data. The main components of my visualisation are streams and concentric rings.</p>

            <h4><i>Guide to interpretation</i></h4>
            <br>
            <p><b>Streams:</b> Much like the stream graph, the area of a stream is generated using polylines based on the sum values of each genre, in each time period. The area within a time period in a given stream corresponds to the volume of album reviews in that genre or category. Our visualisation shows the six most biggest genres of the Pitchfork album reviews dataset for the period between 2010 and 2016.</p>
            <br>
            <p><b>Concentric Rings:</b> Here in the visualisation there are a maximum of three rings that could be presented in a given year by genre cluster. Our visualisation emphasises outliers or albums that were rated very low (less than 2) or albums that were rated very high (more than 9). For each circle cluster, there are 3 rings. The inner-most ring is populated by the low rated albums, the middle ring represents albums scoring between above 2 and less than 9, and the outer-most ring emphasises the highly-rated albums that scored more than 9. </p>

            <h2>Findings</h2>
              <br>
                <h3>Confirmed expected outcomes - Rock dominates Pitchfork reviews</h3>
              <br>
              <p>In general, the most popular genre overtime for Pitchfork to review is Rock and the number of Rock album reviews has stayed relatively similar compared to other genres. Furthermore, in line with the popularity of rock, the genre overtime has the most highly-rated albums relative to other genres, represented by the dotted outer rings of the circles inside the Rock stream.</p>
              <br>
              <p>As expected, overall most albums in all genres at all time periods mostly scored within the middle ring of their cluster, the middle ring reflects albums that scored between above 2 and 9 or less. Visually this is represented by the densely dotted middle ring, populated by these albums.</p>

              <h3>Unexpected findings</h3>
              <br>
              <p>The genres of Pop/R&B, Experimental and None did not have any albums that scored below 2 between the period of 2010 and 2016 as signified by the absence of nodes in the inner-most ring. Interestingly, the Pop/R&B achieved a dramatic increase of 10 highly-rated albums in 2016 as shown by the dotted outer ring. Further inspection showed that 5 of these albums were by the Artist Prince, who passed away that year.</p>

            <p>In contrast the Rock genre in 2016 showed the most instances of highly rated albums above score 9, with a total of 17 albums achieving this score in that year. Some of these albums reviewed in this time include 2 albums by the artist David Bowie (Low and Heroes), whom passed away that year. Another album reviewed was I’m Your Man by the artist Leonard Cohen who also passed away that year.</p>
