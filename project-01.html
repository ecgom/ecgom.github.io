						<p>Campsite is a novel representation of real-world data inspired by Aboriginal dot paintings. I designed, implemented and evaluated Campsite during my time as a Winter Research Assistant and Masters student at The University of Sydney, under the supervision of Professor Seokhee Hong.

            <h3>01 — Problem</h3>
            <br>
						<p>The importance of visual analytics has grown due to increasing data volumes and the role of data in aiding human decision-making in diverse fields such as business, government policy and medicine. Current problems with visualisation of big complex data include computational complexity: more efficient algorithms for visualisations are needed, and visual complexity: the effectiveness and readability of visualisations that take into account limitations of human perception.</p>

            <h3>02 — Concept & Design</h3>
            <br>
            <p>The use of metaphors in visual analytics systems aids people to intuitively understand data, through visual representations that are in line with real-world and/or familiar symbols and experiences. In Aboriginal dot painting, motifs of the natural world are prevalent and include streams/running water, and campsites that are meeting places. Conceptually, there are loose parallels with the way nodes and edges in a graph are represented, i.e. streams (edges) connect to campsites (nodes/clusters). Concentric circles within those campsites hint at the possibility of representing additional information, for nodes and/or clusters within a graph. Campsite was born out of this opportunity of representing data in a new and useful way, inspired by the aesthetics of Aboriginal dot paintings.</p>

            <p>Campsite is created by obtaining a Voronoi diagram of cluster co-ordinates of a network graph. This results in convex polygons, each representing a cluster region. Concentric circles are drawn inside of these regions, and nodes are assigned to a layer of the concentric circle based on some pre-defined metric. Examples of metrics that can be used include centrality analysis and k-core analysis. The concentric circles can also distinguish nodes by a second categorical type, allowing flexibility in the nature of data Campsite can take in as input. </p>

            <p>Polbooks is a network graph where each vertex represents a US politics book published around the time of the 2004 US presidential elections. An edge between two vertices represents co-purchasing of the pair of books by the same buyer. A concentric circle region denotes an individual cluster based on multi-dimensional scaling. A node in that cluster is assigned to a concentric ring based on centrality analysis, with more important nodes assigned to the inner ring. </p>

                <h3>Confirmed expected outcomes</h3>
              <br>
              <p>The results from the clusters by multi-dimensional scaling show that the polbooks dataset has some over-arching cluster themes. It was expected that there will be distinct clusters for each political party (Republican and Liberal) as buyers may favour or politically identify with one party and thus read books related to that party. Cluster 6 appears to suggest a “Clinton” region, as the majority of those books in that cluster are about the Clintons and/or the Liberal party. While the small cluster 5 suggests a Republican supporter theme that contains books about Republican party’s George Bush’s life in Shrubs and positive accounts of Bush’s effect on foreign policy in America Unbound.</p>

              <br>
              <p>Cluster 4 with the largest cluster region appears to show a theme of books centred around uncovering lies and deceit, irrespective of the political party to which it is about. This shows that the book readers in this cluster are likely to co-purchase books that have a general lie theme irrespective of their personal political standings. Cluster 1 features books centred around the US military and terrorism (Rumsfeld’s War and The Man Who Warned America) but also features books about political figures’ wives (Hillary’s scheme about Hillary Clinton and The Perfect Wife about Laura Bush), suggesting these two seemingly unrelated themes are frequently co-purchased together. The book The Death of Right and Wrong in Cluster 2 was the only node in the whole graph in the first layer representing the upper quartile of centrality scores suggesting it was the most popular co-purchased book. This suggest the contents of this book stands out to compel for both readers within cluster 2 and other clusters.

              <p>On an individual country level analysis, confirmed expected outcomes include the highest popularity of vegetarian dishes in India. Similarly, the pasta category is the most popular category in Italy, the country to which the meal was invented and known for. In terms of between cluster similarity, (denoted by proximity of the position of clusters), the closeness of the UK, USA, France and Italy was expected given their geographical proximity to each other (in the case of France and Italy) and suggests cultural similarities in popular meal categories. </p>

              <h3>Unexpected findings</h3>
              <br>
              <p>It was expected that the Dessert category would dominate in the French cluster due to France’s reputation for dessert making, however it was the second least popular category recorded in the dataset. Surprisingly, the Dessert category was the most popular for the UK and USA suggesting UK and USA dessert meals have a wider interest to the public and variety than first assumed. Moreover, the China cluster is located farther from other countries in the same geographical regions (India and Japan). It was expected that China and Japan would share similar patterns in meal category popularity. Our representation shows that meat-based meals of Pork and Beef are popular in China and do not feature in the countries of Japan and India. We suspect this may be the results of multi-dimensional scaling that found China to be more similar to France and Italy with respect to the presence and frequency of pork and beef meals.</p>
